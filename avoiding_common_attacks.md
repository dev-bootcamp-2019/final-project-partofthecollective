My contract is a simple contract and mostly just stores data using the `Mapping Iterator` design pattern.  This contract doesn't handle any ether balances or withdrawing ether, or transferring of ether.  This contract has a fallback revert method, and most of the transactions are handled directly with the user through their MetaMask account balances in a peer to peer fashion, including tipping the author of a a post.
